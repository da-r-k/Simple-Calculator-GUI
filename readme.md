* The Backspace key works as backspace for the input, whereas the Delete key resets the calculator. 
 
* The calculator calculates the entries simultaneously, similar to the simple calculator inbuilt  in Windows 10. It doesnâ€™t take BODMAS rules into account. 
 
* The window may resize automatically if the length of string corresponding to the number displayed is larger than it can hold.
